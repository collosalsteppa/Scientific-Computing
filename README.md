For the first script labelled datatypes.py
I wrote a python script that creates at least one variable in each data type and prints the variable type using pythons inbuilt type() function.
It also converts the integer variable into a float and then does the viceversa and prints both results.
How to run the code:
  Save the code in a file named datatypes.py.
  Open a terminal or command prompt.
  Navigate to the directory where the file is saved.
  Run the script using the command:
  python datatypes.py

For the second script labelled control_structures.py
I created a python script that asks for integer input from a user and checks if the integer is odd or even.
It then uses a for loop to generate a list of odd numbers from 1 to 50 and prints the list.
It also usesa while loop to print numbers from 10 to 1.
How to run the code:
  Save the code in a file named control_structures.py.
  Open a terminal or command prompt.
  Navigate to the directory where the file is saved.
  Run the script using the command:
  python control_structures.py

For the third script labelled modular_functions.py
I created a python script that calculates the area of various shapes( circle, rectangle, triangle).
Depending on the shape specified the code implements the correct formulae to obtain the area and prints it out.
How to run the code:
  Save the code in a file named modular_functions.py.
  Open a terminal or command prompt.
  Navigate to the directory where the file is saved.
  Run the script using the command:
  python modular_functions.py

For the fourth script labelled numpy_basics.py
I created a python script that creates a 2D NumPy array with two rows and three columns.
It retrieves the shape of the array (but does not print it).
It prints the contents of the array to the console.
How to run the code:
  Save the code in a file named numpy_basics.py
  Open a terminal or command prompt.
  Navigate to the directory where the file is saved.
  Run the script using the command:
  python numpy_basics.py
